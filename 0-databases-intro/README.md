# Databases & PostgreSQL

- Databases store information
- Some amount of data from some source is persistet in a database (in-memory or disk)
- Data can be retrieved at a future point in time
- To work with a Postgres database, we connect to it with a client (can be any piece of software, e.g., API server, utility program, etc.)
- SQL is used to interact with databases
- Challenges of Postgres
    - Writing efficient queries to retrieve information
    - Designing the schema, or structure, of the database
    - Understanding when to use advanced features
    - Managing the database in a production environment
- Database design process
    - What kind of _thing_ are we storing?
    - What properties does this thing have?
    - What _type_ of data does each of those properties contain?
- Table: Collection of records (that have a related meaning)
- Columns: Each column records one property about a thing
- Rows: Each row represents on "thing"
- SQL statmements consist of different words
    - Keywords: Tell the database that we want to do something (always written out in capital letters)
    - Identifiers: Tell the database what thing we want to act on (always written out in lower case letters)
