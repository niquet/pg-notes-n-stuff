## Overview

- PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database syste
- Key features:
  - ACID compliance
  - Support for JSON and other NoSQL features
  - Extensibility
  - Full-text search
  - Concurrent access and high performance
 
## Connecting to PostgreSQL

- Clients can connect to PostgreSQL using various methods:
  - Command-line tool (psql)
  - GUI tools (pgAdmin, DBeaver)
  - Application code using database drivers (e.g., psycopg2 for Python)
- Example connection string: `postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database`
